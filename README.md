# Small-Python-Projects for learning
Just some small python projects that I have created in the process of learning.
These project were created using [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can [download and install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) it, or [use it online](https://vscode.dev/).
You can follow along these small programs to learn python.

# UPCOMING PROJECT
## Inventory management system with Database and GUI
Code for an inventory management system was [already avaiable online](https://www.sourcecodester.com/python/16703/stock-inventory-system-python-free-source-code.html) in the form of a menu driven program instead of using GUI. So I borrowed the logic from this code, and added a GUI as well as a compound ingredient feature.
I followed [this](https://medium.com/@fareedkhandev/modern-gui-using-tkinter-12da0b983e22) article to implement customtkinter.
